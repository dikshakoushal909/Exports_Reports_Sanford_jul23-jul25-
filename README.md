# Exports_Reports_Sanford_jul23-jul25-
**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
This project is based on export data for New Zealand’s aquaculture industry.  
I built this analysis to understand which markets, products, and species performed best from FY23 to FY25.  
The main goal was to identify market trends, compare growth, and evaluate pricing using Power BI and SQL.

**DATA AND PROCESS**
1. Used SQL scripts to clean and merge export data for FY23–FY25.  
2. Created views for Right Market, Right Product, and Right Price analysis.  
3. Connected the cleaned data to Power BI for visualization.  
4. Designed dashboards showing country-wise growth, pricing index, and export trends.
